# Initializing Dropbox

This is a pain.

The first time CrispyBox starts, the Dropbox daemon will start.

After a bunch of scrolling text, you will see something like this repeated over and over:
```
Please visit https://www.dropbox.com/cli_link....
```

Go to that webpage, and login to your Dropbox account.
