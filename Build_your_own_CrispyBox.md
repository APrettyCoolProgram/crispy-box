# Building your own CrispyBox
You'll need to build CrispyBox yourself if want/need to:
* use a non-Debian-based Linux distribution
* use a cloud provider other than Dropbox
* have more than a maximum of 10GB (9GB for Dropbox) available for storage
* use a fixed HDD instead of a dynamic HDD
* have a swap partition
* just have alot of fun!

If you are not familiar with Linux, or just want to get CrispyBox up and running, I would recommend [downloading the standard build of CrispyBox](https://github.com/APrettyCoolProgram/CrispyBox/blob/master/Get_official.md) release.

If you decide to build your own CrispyBox, you can choose from these tutorials:

[**Standard CrispyBox**](https://github.com/APrettyCoolProgram/CrispyBox/blob/master/Build_standard.md)
This version of CrispyBox is as close to "official" as you can get. It's built on Debian , which is a stable and supported operating system. It uses VirtualBox, which is cross-platform. The standard build doesn't have any of the experimental features
