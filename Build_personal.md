# Building the standard build of CrispyBox
*These instructions will build a personal CrispyBox, version 0.9.5-beta+180124* Â 

## What is the a personal CrispyBox
A personal build of CrispyBox is the standard build with some security removed to make it easier to start. It's called "personal" because you should only use this build in environments that you have total control over, since once you start CrispyBox everything will just start working (although you will still need to use your CrispyBox credentials to login to the samba share).

## Requirements
* A [standard build] of CrispyBox (https://github.com/APrettyCoolProgram/CrispyBox/blob/master/Build_standard.md)
* An internet connection
* About 5 minutes
