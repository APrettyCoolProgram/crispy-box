# Pre-built CrispyBox

#### Requirements
In order to use a pre-built CrispyBox image, you will need VirtualBox (recommended version 5.2.6).

Then, download one of the available pre-built CrispyBox images:

* The [**standard**](http://aprettycoolprogram.com/projects/crispybox/CrispyBox_0.9.6-base+180131_10GB-fixedHDD_500MB-swap_512MB-RAM.7z) CrispyBox is a 10GB fixed HDD, a 500MB swap partition, and 512MB RAM. This image will take 10GB of space on your host, but may perform better than the compact image.

* The [**compact**](http://aprettycoolprogram.com/projects/crispybox/CrispyBox_0.9.6-base+180131_10GB-dynamicHDD_noswap_512MB-RAM.7z) CrispyBox is a 10GB dynamic HDD, no swap partition, and 512MB RAM. The compact version allows you to use the VBoxManage utility to reduce the size of the .vdi file on the host, which is helpful when disk space is an issue.

And you can always [building your own CrispyBox](https://github.com/APrettyCoolProgram/CrispyBox/blob/master/Build_your_own.md)
