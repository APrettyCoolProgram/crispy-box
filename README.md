# ABOUT THIS REPOSITORY
CrispyBox, is a small-footprint, cross-platform, portable, official Dropbox client built on a VirtualBox Linux VM using SAMBA.

CrispyBox is updated at the beginning of every year. After that, all updates are done from within the VM.

# FEATURES
* CrispyBox is **tiny**. The standard build of CrispyBox only needs 512MB RAM, and will take up the amount of space to store your Dropbox data, plus about 1GB for CrispyBox itself.
* CrispyBox is **cross-platform**. The standard build of CrispyBox uses Oracle's VirtualBox virtualization software, which is available for Windows, MacOS, and Linux.
* CrispyBox is **portable**, and can be run from pretty much anywhere, from your local HDD to a USB drive. The only requirement is that you'll need VirtualBox software installed on the computers you want to run CrispyBox.
* CrispyBox is **secure**. By default, CrispyBox requires your credentials to start, Dropbox data is only available when CrispyBox is running, and then is only available via a password-protected samba share.

# REQUIREMENTS
In order to use CrispyBox, you'll need:
* Oracle VirtualBox, ([version 6.1.0 recommended](https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads))
* The [CrispyBox 20.0 VirtualBox Virtual Machine image](https://github.com/APrettyCoolProgram/CrispyBox/releases/download/20.0/CrispyBox-20.0.7z) (or, if you would like, you can also [build your own](https://github.com/APrettyCoolProgram/crispy-box/blob/master/document/building-crispybox-from-scratch.md))
* 512MB of RAM and a minimum of 2GBGB space to store the VM (which may increase, depending on use)

# BEFORE YOU BEGIN
CrispyBox is updated once a year in January.

### RELATED PROJECTS
* [**Crispy**](https://github.com/APrettyCoolProgram/crispy)

# GETTING STARTED
Before we continue, please verify you have met the [requirements](#requirements).

# USAGE
When you spin up your CrispyBox, the Dropbox deamon will automatically start. Follow the on-screen instructions to start syncing your data.

Once Dropbox starts syncing, you'll need to get the IP Address of the CrispyBox, so you'll know where to map. First, open a new instance of screen:

```Ctrl-A, c```

then get the IP for CrispyBox:

```$ ip addr show```

Finally, using your preferred method, map to "\\<IP_ADDRESS>\CrispyBox".
